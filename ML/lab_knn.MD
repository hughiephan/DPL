# Lab: K-Algorithms

## Requirements

- `Requirement 1`: Choose a K-Algorithms of your choice: KDTree, KNN, K-Means, K-Means++, K-Medoids
- `Requirement 2`: Choose a Machine Learning task of your choice: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Classification, Regression, Clustering, Image Recognition, Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems,...
- `Requirement 3`: Choose any dataset of your choice
- `Requirement 4`: Apply EDA
- `Requirement 5`: Train and Predict your model
- `Requirement 6`: Evaluate your model

## Scoring Criteria

You will be graded based on Originality of your implementation: Did you implement anything new in the model or just re-use it? How much work did you put into implementing your model? Result of your implementation: Accuracy, Loss, Cross-validation Q/A to test your understanding: How well do you understand your code? How well do you understand your model algorithm? Note: DO NOT add comments in your code
