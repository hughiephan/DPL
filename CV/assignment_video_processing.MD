# Video Processing

We will explore two different approaches for video processing: one utilizing a traditional algorithm and the other employing a deep learning model

## Requirements:
- `Requirement 1`: Choose ONE traditional algorithm 
- `Requirement 2`: Choose ONE deep learning model
- `Requirement 3`: Choose ONE AI task related to video processing of your choice like Object Detection, Video Segmentation, Trajectory Prediction,..
- `Requirement 4`: Choose ONE platform to build your application like website, phone, gradio, streamlit or just notebook,..
- `Requirement 5`: Build a demo with your traditional algorithm and capture a 1-minute video showcasing it.
- `Requirement 5`: Build a demo with your deep learning model and capture a 1-minute video showcasing it.
