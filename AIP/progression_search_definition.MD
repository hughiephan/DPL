A task id $t$ is unconstrained in a task network $(T, \prec, \alpha)$ if and only if there is no task $\acute{t} \in T$ such that $(\acute{t}, t) \in \prec)$

Explanation: Unconstrained tasks are tasks that have no predecessors in the network. So in this case there should not be any task $\acute{t}$ before our unconstrained tasks.

Example: `t1` and `t2.1` are our unconstrained tasks.
```
tn2: 
  task: t1, t2.1, t2.2, t2.3, t2.4
  precondition: <t2.1, t2.2, t2.3, t2.4>
  alpha:
    t1: deliver(P1, B),
    t2.1: get-to(T2, C),
    t2.2: pick-up(T2, C, P2),
    t2.3: get-to(T2, D),
    t2.4: drop(T2, D, P2)
```

## Search Node

$$
n = (s, (T, \prec, \alpha), \pi)
$$

Search Node consists of:

- $s$: Current state
- $(T, \prec, \alpha)$: Task network
- $\pi$: Sequence of the current plan

## Fringe

Fringe is a list of search nodes. It is like a stack, but we can control the position of search nodes in the fringe based on some cost of heuristics.

Example:
```
fringe:
  fringe_position_0:
    state: s0
    tnI: 
      task: t1, t2
      precondition: <>
      alpha:
        t1: deliver(P1,B),
        t2: deliver(P2,D)
    pi: <>
  ....
  fringe_position_X:
    state: s2.2.1
    tn2.2.1: 
      task: t1.1, t1.2, t1.3, t1.4, t2.1.1, t2.2, t2.3, t2.4
      precondition: 
        <t1.1, t1.2, t1.3, t1.4>,
        <t2.1.1, t2.2, t2.3, t2.4>
      alpha:
        t1.1: get-to(T1, A),
        t1.2: pick-up(T1, A, P1),
        t1.3: get-to(T1, B),
        t1.4: drop(T1, B, P1),
        t2.1.1: no-op(),
        t2.2: pick-up(T2, C, P2),
        t2.3: get-to(T2, D),
        t2.4: drop(T2, D, P2)
    pi: <>
  ...
  fringe_position_Y:
    state: s2.2.1.2
    tn2.2.1: 
      task: t1.1, t1.2, t1.3, t1.4, t2.1.1, t2.2, t2.3, t2.4
      precondition: 
        <t1.1, t1.2, t1.3, t1.4>,
        <t2.2, t2.3, t2.4>
      alpha:
        t1.1: get-to(T1, A),
        t1.2: pick-up(T1, A, P1),
        t1.3: get-to(T1, B),
        t1.4: drop(T1, B, P1),
        t2.2: pick-up(T2, C, P2),
        t2.3: get-to(T2, D),
        t2.4: drop(T2, D, P2)
    pi: <no-op()>
```


## Standard Progression Search Algorithm

01. $fringe \gets { \{(s_0, tn_I, \epsilon) \} }$

02. While $fringe \neq \emptyset$ Do

03. &nbsp;&nbsp; $n \xleftarrow{} fringe.pop()$

04. &nbsp;&nbsp; If $n.isgoal$ then return $n$ 

05. &nbsp;&nbsp; $U  \xleftarrow[]{} n.unconstrainedNodes$

06. &nbsp;&nbsp; For $t \in U$ do

07. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If $isPrimitive(t)$ then

08. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If $isApplicable(t)$ then

09. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\acute{n} \xleftarrow[]{} n.apply(t)$

10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $fringe.add(\acute{n})$

11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else

12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For $m \in t.methods$ do

13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\acute{n} \xleftarrow[]{} n.decompose(t,m)$

14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $fringe.add(\acute{n})$

15. Return $unsolvable$

- $s_0$: initial state
- $tn_I$: initial task network
- $\epsilon$: an empty sequence

Explanation:
- Add first, add a search node into the fringe.
- Fringe will be sorted according to some heuristic. For example: based on the priority (distance between nodes), we can sort the fringe.  
- Test if the popped node is the solution

## Applicable

To determine whether an action is applicable in a given state, the planner checks whether all the preconditions of that action are true in the current state. If all preconditions are satisfied, the action is considered applicable in the current state and can be considered as a candidate for execution.

For unconstrained action, there is:
- No possible modification when it is not applicable
- Exactly one modfiication when it is applicable

With `modification` means progressing the action and updating the state

## Solution

![image](https://github.com/hughiephan/DPL/assets/16631121/9a0f496c-a3ce-4390-af3b-77b8984f12f8)

$$
n = (s, (T, \prec, \alpha), \pi)
$$

The node will be a solution if and only if:
- Task network is empty $T = \emptyset$
- State is goal state $s \supseteq g$

With:
- $\pi$: generated plan

Explanation:
- When we have processed all the tasks in the task network, then the task network will be empty and we are now done.
- Even though not mention but I think we need a Goal Test to determines whether a given state is a goal state.


## Decomposition
Explanation:
- There is similarity between decomposition, in previous paper it is used to decompose task network. It this paper it is used to decompose a new search node.

## Progression

$$
\acute{n} = (\acute{s}, (\acute{T}, \acute{\prec}, \acute{\alpha}), \acute{\pi}
$$ 

Given:
- a search node $n = (s, T, \prec, \alpha, \pi)$
- $t \in T$: unconstrained task
- $\acute{n}$: search node from progressing $t$

With:
- $\acute{s} = \gamma ( \alpha(t), s )$ 
- $\acute{T} = T$ \ { $t$ }
- $\acute{\prec} = \prec$ \ { $(t,\acute{t}) | \acute{t} \in T$ }
- $\acute{\alpha} = \alpha$ \ { $t \mapsto \alpha(t)$ }  
- $\acute{\pi} = \pi \cdot \alpha(t)$

Explanation:
- Transition function gamma $\gamma$ to transform the task names and state to a new state.
- List of new tasks should remove the unconstrained task we just processed.
- The new precondition remove the precondition relationship between the unconstrained task 
- The $\alpha$ mapping of the unconstrained task will be removed also.
- The goal $\pi$ is also updated by adding the task names 

## Solution Criteria
$$
tn = (T, \prec, \alpha)
$$

The task network $tn$ is a solution if and only if:
- $tn_I \xrightarrow{*} tn$: can be reached by decomposing the initial task network
- $\forall(t) \in T: \alpha(t) \in A$: all task names are primitive
- Sequence of task ??

# Extra
## Questions
- Application of method?
- Applicable action?
- Useful for calculating heuristics?
- Primitive tasks (also called actions) can be directly executed and cause state transition, so does decomposing cause state transition?
- Why dot product for goal?
