# Lab: K-Algorithms

Choose one K-Algorithms of your choice `KDTree`, `KNN`, `K-Means`, `K-Means++`, `K-Medoids` for a Machine Learning task of your choice `Supervised Learning`, `Unsupervised Learning`, `Classification`, `Regression`, `Clustering`,...

## Requirements

Choose `ONE AI task` of your choice: Image Recognition, Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems, Predictive Maintenance, Healthcare Diagnostics, Text Mining, Credit Risk Assessment, Handwriting Recognition, Market Segmentation... with `ONE Dataset` of your choice and apply KNN.

Example: AI Task: `Fraud Detection`. Dataset: `Credit Card Dataset`

## Scoring Criteria

You will be graded based on Originality of your implementation: Did you implement anything new in the model or just re-use it? How much work did you put into implementing your model? Result of your implementation: Accuracy, Loss, Cross-validation Q/A to test your understanding: How well do you understand your code? How well do you understand Neural Network concepts? Note: DO NOT add comments in your code
