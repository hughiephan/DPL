# Lab: Dimensionality Reduction

Train a PCA or LDA for an AI task

## Requirements

- `Requirement 1`: Choose a Dimensionality Algorithm of your choice: PCA, LDA
- `Requirement 2`: Choose a Machine Learning Task of your choice: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning.
- `Requirement 3`: Choose any dataset of your choice
- `Requirement 4`: Apply EDA
- `Requirement 5`: Train and Predict with your model
- `Requirement 6`: Evaluate your model
- `Requirement 7`: Evaluate another model without Dimesionality Reduction applied

## Scoring Criteria

You will be graded based on Originality of your implementation: Did you implement anything new in the model or just re-use it? How much work did you put into implementing your model? Result of your implementation: Accuracy, Loss, Cross-validation Q/A to test your understanding: How well do you understand your code? How well do you understand Machine Learning concepts? Note: DO NOT add comments in your code
