# Progression Search Formal Definition

In AI search algorithms, the state (or search) space is usually represented as a graph, where nodes are states and the edges are the connections (or actions) between the corresponding states. 

# Unconstrained Task
A task id $t$ is unconstrained in a task network $(T, \prec, \alpha)$ if and only if there is no task $\acute{t} \in T$ such that $(\acute{t},t) in \prec)$
