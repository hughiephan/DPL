# Lab: Face Detection

Gain an understanding of the chosen face detection algorithm, such as Haar Cascade Classifiers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Requirement
Develop the ability to implement the chosen face detection algorithm using Python and OpenCV. Apply the algorithm to a dataset containing images with faces, such as the "Labeled Faces in the Wild" dataset.
