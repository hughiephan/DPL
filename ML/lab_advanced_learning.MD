## Requirements

- `Requirement 1`: Choose the algorithms or models of your choice. While not obligatory, opting for either from-scratch implementation or using advanced techniques from a research paper will receive higher evaluation.
- `Requirement 2`: Choose an Advanced Learning Task of your choice: Ensemble Learning, Transfer Learning, Distillation Learning, Active Learning, Contrastive Learning
- `Requirement 3`: Choose any dataset of your choice
- `Requirement 4`: Apply EDA and pre-processing. Your extracted features, plots, or insights need to be directly related to why they help your algorithm or model perform better
- `Requirement 5`: Train and predict
- `Requirement 6`: Evaluate the metrics
- `Requirement 7`: Compare with another algorithm or model and explain why one is better or worse.
- `Requirement 8`: Based on your work, create a simple demo. For example face detection, recommendation system...
- `Requirement 9`: Make a short 1-minute video to showcase your demo.

## Scoring Criteria

You will be graded based on the Originality of your implementation: Did you implement anything new in the model or just re-use it? How much work did you put into implementing your model? Result of your implementation: Accuracy, Loss, Cross-validation. Q/A to test your understanding: How well do you understand your code? How well do you understand Machine Learning concepts? Note: DO NOT add comments to your code
