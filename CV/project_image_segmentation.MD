# Project: Image Segmentation

## Question
Train a CNN model for an Image Segmentation Task.

## Requirements
Choose `ONE CNN` model.  Chose `ONE TASK`: Semantic Segmentation, Instance Segmentation. With `ONE Dataset` of your choice. 

You can use any deep learning technique: Transfer learning, Pre-train, Finetune, Ensemble learning, Hyperparameter tuning, Pre-process image, Data augmentation, Build from scratch...

## Scoring Criteria
You will be graded based on Originality of your implementation: Did you implement anything new in the model or just re-use it? How much work did you put into implementing your model? Result of your implementation: Accuracy, Loss, Cross-validation Q/A to test your understanding: How well do you understand your code? How well do you understand Neural Network concepts? Note: DO NOT add comments in your code
