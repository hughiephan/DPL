# Lab: Support Vector Machine

Train a SVM for an AI task

## Requirements

Choose `ONE AI task` of your choice: Image Classification, Text Classification, Recognition, Healthcare, Financial Forecasting... with `ONE Dataset` of your choice and apply SVM.

Example: AI Task: `Fraud Detection`. Dataset: `Credit Card Dataset`

## Scoring Criteria

You will be graded based on Originality of your implementation: Did you implement anything new in the model or just re-use it? How much work did you put into implementing your model? Result of your implementation: Accuracy, Loss, Cross-validation Q/A to test your understanding: How well do you understand your code? How well do you understand Neural Network concepts? Note: DO NOT add comments in your code
