# Lab: NLP with Neural Networks

## Question
Train a Neural Network model for a Language Processing task

## Requirements
Choose ONE Neural Network model of your choice.

Then choose ONE Language Processing task from this list: Text Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering, Translation, Summarization, Text Generation, Named Entity Recognition, Human Voice Detection

With ONE Dataset of your choice.

You can use any deep learning technique: Transfer learning, Pre-train, Finetune, Ensemble learning, Hyperparameter tuning, Pre-process image, Data augmentation, Build from scratch...

## Example

Neural Network: `BERT`. Language Processing Task: `Question Answering`. Dataset: `Vietnamese Question-answer Dataset` https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/uit-viquad

## Scoring Criteria

You will be graded based on Originality of your implementation: Did you implement anything new in the model or just re-use it? How much work did you put into implementing your model? Result of your implementation: Accuracy, Loss, Cross-validation Q/A to test your understanding: How well do you understand your code? How well do you understand Neural Network concepts? Note: DO NOT add comments in your code
