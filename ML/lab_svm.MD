# Lab: Support Vector Machine

Train a SVM for an AI task

## Requirements

- `Requirement 1`: Choose a SVM with any Kernel of your choice. While not obligatory, opting for either from-scratch implementation or using advanced techniques from a research paper will receive higher evaluation.
- `Requirement 2`: Choose a Machine Learning Task of your choice: Regression, Classification
- `Requirement 3`: Choose any dataset of your choice
- `Requirement 4`: Apply EDA and Pre-processing. Your extracted features, plots, or insights need to be directly related to why it helps your SVM Algorithm peform better
- `Requirement 5`: Train and Predict with your SVM
- `Requirement 6`: Evaluate your SVM metrics
- `Requirement 7`: Compare your SVM with another algorithm or from a different kernel and explain why one is better or worse.

## Scoring Criteria

You will be graded based on Originality of your implementation: Did you implement anything new in the model or just re-use it? How much work did you put into implementing your model? Result of your implementation: Accuracy, Loss, Cross-validation Q/A to test your understanding: How well do you understand your code? How well do you understand Machine Learning concepts? Note: DO NOT add comments in your code
