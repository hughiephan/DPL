# Face Detection

We will explore two different approaches for face detection: one utilizing a traditional algorithm and the other employing a deep learning model. Face detection is a crucial component in various applications such as identity verification, emotion recognition, and surveillance systems.

## Requirements:

- `Requirement 1`: Choose ONE traditional algorithm like Haar Cascade Classifiers
- `Requirement 2`: Choose ONE deep learning model
- `Requirement 3`: Choose ONE of the following task like identity verification, emotion recognition, age estimation, gender classification, automatic tagging, surveillance
- `Requirement 4`: Choose ONE platform to build your application like website, phone, gradio, or just notebook..
- `Requirement 5`: Build a Face Detection Application using a chosen traditional algorithm
- `Requirement 6`: Build a Face Detection Application using a chosen deep learning model
